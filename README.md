# MovieRatingApp
This is a movie rating web app that I have implemented in a team for the Software Engineering Lab at the university of Duisburg Essen(Winter Semester 2021/2022), The documentation of the analysis of the problem and the architectural design of this app can be found in the file **MovieRatingAppDocumentation**. The analysis phase includes context and problem diagrams, sequence diagrams for the abstract software specification, OCL statements for the operation specification and lifecycle expression along with some validation of the steps of the analysis phase. As for the architectural design we have used layered architecture for the app and used sequence diagrams for the documentation of the intercomponent relations. At the end of this step there is a state machine which describes the general structure and behaviour of the web app.
For implementing the application, we used MySql server for the database and java as a programming language for the application which was extended by Java servlets. For the component testing as well as the system testing we used JUnit along with Mockito framework. In the front-end, we used freemarker as a template engine
